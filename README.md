Day-40

Today's topic was Capstone Project - Flight Deal Finder in python, which was wonderfully explained by Angela Yu.

What did I use?

Worked on various topics that were covered past few days. I used the following APIs to make this project happen:

Tequila used to make flight searches.
Sheety used to integrate google sheets with our application.
Twilio used to send SMS.
SMTP library to send mails to those who have subscribed to the platform.

Project of the day

Flight Deal Finder - 2 using the above mentioned topics. You can checkout my code. You can also clone and run on local machine using an IDE. 

Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank MYSELF for being self-motivated throughout the lecture.
